# About Me:
I’m a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, majoring in Computer Science. Prior to joining CU Boulder, I worked as a Software Engineer for 1.3 years in the FinTech industry.

It has been a while since I started to explore this dynamic field of Computer Science and currently, I would say that I’m all about two things - one, crafting innovative software solutions, and second, navigating the intricate world of data and intelligence. I love tackling challenges and applying my technical expertise to create solutions that don't just solve problems but also drive growth.
